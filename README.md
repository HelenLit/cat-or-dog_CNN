# cat-or-dog_CNN
This is my laboratory work from DeepLearning.AI course "Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow".

The aim of this work is to create model of convolutional neural network which classifies cats and dogs.
In this lab I used at the famous [Kaggle Dogs v Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).This was originally a challenge in building a classifier aimed at the world's best Machine Learning and AI Practitioners.
